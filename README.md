<h1 style="text-align: center">Blueprint Js || Material Table</h1>

I'm trying to figure out which table best fits my need. <br>
I'm also prototyping a wrapper around these tables to handle the formatting and
custom functions each column/cell may have

To run:
You'll need to run npm install && npm build on data.
Then you'll need to run yarn install && npm link ../data inside of the blueprint_ts
Then inside of the same folder run yarn start
