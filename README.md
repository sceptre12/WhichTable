<h1 style="text-align: center">Blueprint Js || Material Table</h1>

I'm trying to figure out which table best fits my need. <br>
I'm also prototyping a wrapper around these tables to handle the formatting and
custom functions each column/cell may have

You'll need to build the data project first and then run yarn start on the other projects..

The only project working right now is the BlueprintJs project
